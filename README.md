##### Notes
This app was coded with the notion that I would be the only person working on it.

### JS 
JQuery is leveraged for its selectors and event handling. 
The codes primary intent is to be readable, modular, and robust.
The HTML only has two elements with explicit identifiers, which 
forces the JS to use more complex selectors within events. 

### CSS
SASS is great for the variables, mixins, and how it can be written 
in a way that mirrors markup -- but this app is too small to warrant 
using it. 
The default behavior set for certain elements is based on personal 
preference.    
 
### HTML
Standard markup syntax structure is followed as closely as possible.
Minimal element identifiers are used(class names and ids). It is an 
idealistic approach, but not that effective when working within engineering
teams.
